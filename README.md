## Description 

A simple app that helps generate a README for your projects based on a set of prompts.



## Installation

To install this project, first navigate to or create the folder you will clone the project into. Then clone the project from https://github.com/KingPogona/ReadMe-Generator by clicking the code button and then copy the address. Next go to your terminal and make sure you are in the folder you want to clone the project to. Type git clone and then paste the url you just copied then hit return. Alternatively, you can download the zip from the same address and unzip it to the desired folder.
    

    
## Usage 

To use this app will require having Node.js installed on your machine. After installing the app, navigate to the root folder 'ReadMe-Generator' in your terminal. Next, type 'node index" followed by hitting enter. This will run the program and provide a list of prompts. After answering every prompt the program will generate the completed README.md file in the dist folder within ReadMe-Generator. Now you can further edit this file as you see fit and use this readme however you like. If you want to generate another README.md simply make sure you have navigated to the 'ReadMe-Generator' root folder in your terminal and run 'node index' once more. Please note that this will over-write any README.md in the dist folder.
