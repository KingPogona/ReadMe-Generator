## Description 

    A simple app that helps generate a README for your projects based on a set of prompts.



## Installation

    To install this project, simply clone the project from https://github.com/KingPogona/ReadMe-Generator. Alternatively download the zip from the same address and unzip it. Then place the unziped folder where you see fit on your machine.
    

    
## Usage 

    To use this app will require having Node.js installed on your machine. After installing the app, navigate to the root folder 'ReadMe-Generator' in your terminal. Next, type 'node index" followed by hitting enter. This will run the program and provide a list of prompts. After answering every prompt the program will generate the completed README.md file in the dist folder within ReadMe-Generator. Now you can use this readme however you like. If you want to generate another README.md simply make sure you have navigated to the 'ReadMe-Generator' root folder in your terminal  and run 'node index' once more. *Please note that this will over-write any README.md in the dist folder.*
